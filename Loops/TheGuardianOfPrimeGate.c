/*
In the ancient kingdom of Zabiria, there exists a magical gate known as the Prime Gate.

The gate reacts differently depending on the nature of the number it receives:

It opens when given a Prime number
It remains closed when given a Composite number
It stays inactive when given a number that is neither Prime nor Composite
A young programmer Omkar has been chosen to guard the gate. Every day, the gate provides a natural number.
Omkar must determine the correct nature of the number so the gate behaves accordingly.

Your task is to help Omkar by writing a program that checks whether the given number is Prime, Composite, or Neither.

Input Format

A single line containing one number N.

Constraints

-10^9 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 10^9
Output Format

Print Prime, if the number is prime
Print Composite, if the number is composite
Print None, if the number is neither prime nor composite
Sample Input 0

7
Sample Output 0

Prime
Explanation 0

7 is a positive number greater than 1 and has only two divisors (1 and 7), so it is Prime.

Sample Input 1

10
Sample Output 1

Composite
Explanation 1

10 has more than two divisors (1, 2, 5, 10), so it is Composite.

Sample Input 2

1
Sample Output 2

None
Explanation 2

1 is neither prime nor composite, so it is None.
